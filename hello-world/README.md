# Hello, World!

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program): A "Hello, World!" program displays the message "Hello, World!". These programs are simple, and often used to show the basic syntax of a language. They're often the first program written by people learning to code.

This was inspired by [A Month of “Hello, World!”](https://magenta.as/a-month-of-hello-world-496a92b6cec3), but I don't plan on keeping that strict of a schedule, or only limit myself to only 30 languages.

I'll be referencing Wikipedia's [List of Progamming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) and Esolang's [Language list](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list) to keep things from getting boring.
