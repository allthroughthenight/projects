* Libraries
	* [plotly](https://plot.ly/)
	* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* Focuses
	* **Budget**: consolidate monthly workbooks into one yearly workbook with their own worksheets
	* **Diet and Weight**: Track both together, along with bmi measurements (neck and waist)
	* **Exercise**: Ignore machin type(s), only seperate by exercise/motion
	* **Mood Tracking**: Currently no app since no web apps, but is it easier manually?
	* **Run Times**
